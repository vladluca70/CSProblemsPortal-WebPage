# CSProblemsPortal-WebPage

**CSProblemsPortal-WebPage** is an educational web page I created to assist in teaching introductory computer science concepts to my students. It serves as a visual and interactive learning aid, designed to make abstract ideas more approachable and engaging during lectures or self-paced study.

## ✨ Overview

This project provides a lightweight and accessible platform for exploring computer science problems, fundamental terms, and practice tasks. It is ideal for students at the beginning of their programming journey, offering an intuitive navigation menu and interactive content.

The interface was carefully built to emphasize clarity, simplicity, and ease of use.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for structuring page content
- **CSS** – for styling and layout responsiveness
- **JavaScript** – for adding interactivity and dynamic behaviors

---

## 📌 JavaScript Features

The JavaScript code enhances the user experience with several dynamic features, including:

- A **motivational message** that is added to the page dynamically when it loads.
- **Input handling and validation** techniques (such as checking for basic email format).
- **Button styling and navigation**, including hover effects and redirect logic.
- **Real-time translations** for terminology explanations — hover over a problem to see the English version, helping bilingual understanding.
- DOM manipulation and `eventListener` usage to create a more responsive and personalized interaction for users.

These features demonstrate how plain JavaScript can be used effectively in an educational context without relying on any external libraries or frameworks.
